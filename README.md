# Events

This repo explains a brief introduction to react events and how do react events work.
The Mostly used Events in Java Script are
  * onclick
  * onblur
  * onkeyup
  * onmouseover
  * onload
  * onfocus
  * onChange

I mostly discuss about first two that is onlick and onblur in this workflow.
